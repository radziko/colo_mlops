	### Week 1

* [X] Create a git repository
* [X] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
* [X] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
* [X] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
* [X] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
* [X] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
* [X] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
* [X] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project
* [X] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code
* [X] Setup version control for your data or part of your data
* [X] Construct one or multiple docker files for your code
* [X] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended
* [X] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
* [X] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
* [X] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if
      you can optimize your code
* [X] Use Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code. Additionally,
      consider running a hyperparameter optimization sweep.
* [X] Use Pytorch-lightning (if applicable) to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your code

### Week 2

* [X] Write unit tests related to the data part of your code
* [X] Write unit tests related to model construction and or model training
* [%] Calculate the coverage.
* [X] Get some continuous integration running on the github repository
* [X] Create a data storage in GCP Bucket for you data and preferable link this with your data version control setup
* [?] Create a trigger workflow for automatically building your docker images
* [?] Get your model training in GCP using either the Engine or Vertex AI
* [?] Create a FastAPI application that can do inference using your model
* [%] If applicable, consider deploying the model locally using torchserve
* [%] Deploy your model in GCP using either Functions or Run as the backend

### Week 3

* [ ] Check how robust your model is towards data drifting
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the system telemetry of your deployed model
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the performance of your deployed model
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed data loading
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed model training
* [ ] Play around with quantization, compilation and pruning for you trained models to increase inference speed

### Additional

* [ ] Revisit your initial project description. Did the project turn out as you wanted?
* [ ] Make sure all group members have a understanding about all parts of the project
* [ ] Uploaded all your code to github
